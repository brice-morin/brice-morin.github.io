<p><a href='http://www.kevoree.org'>Kevoree</a> aims at enabling distributed reconfigurable software development. Built around a component model, Kevoree leverages model@runtime approach to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.</p>

<p>Francois Fouquet (@dukeboard), Gregory Nain, Erwan Daubert and Jean-Emile Dartois are the core developers of <a href='https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree/contributors'>Kevoree</a>. I am a regular user of Kevoree and a brave beta-tester always willing to try new features and give feedback. Kevoree also implements some ideas (models@runtime), which I promoted in my PhD thesis, but is way more robust, scalable (and comes with a bunch of novel features) than the proof-of-concept which I implemented during my thesis.</p>

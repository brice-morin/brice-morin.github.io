I am a full-time research scientist at SINTEF ICT, Oslo, Norway. My research focuses on investigating sound modeling foundations for software systems, available throughout their lifecycles, including and in particular at runtime. I apply my research to software systems ranging from small embedded systems to large cloud-based systems.

Before, I was a PhD Student at INRIA, in the group of Jean-Marc Jézéquel (<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/triskell/home_html-en">Triskell team</a>). My thesis was about applying Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM) techniques in order to tame the complexity of component-based dynamically adaptive systems. I was funded by INRIA, via the DiVA (Dynamic Variability in Complex Adaptive Systems) Europen project. The manuscript is now available (it includes a useless summary in French, imposed by the French law, which non-French speaking people can skip).

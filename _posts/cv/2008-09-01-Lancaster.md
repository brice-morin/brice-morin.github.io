3-month stay (Sept-Nov 2008) at Lancaster University (UK), funded by the European University of Brittany
(selective admission), in the context of my PhD. I worked with the Middleware department to determine how my
work (and other DiVA technologies) could integrate with the work realized at Lancaster. This stay has been initiated
after the publications of two papers (MODELS conference and models@runtime workshop, 2008). I in particular
worked in close collaboration with Dr. Nelly Bencomo, leading to the publication of a book chapter (published in
2011), and the co-organization of Models@runtime workshop at MODELS 2012.

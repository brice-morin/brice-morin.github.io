ArduPi is a set of projects combining the Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms.

I am the main contributor on this project, whose source code (in C) is fully generated from ThingML models (also included on the repository). The purpose of ArduPi is to demonstrate how Arduino and Raspberry Pi can communicate together, and how a Model-Driven approach like ThingML can help.

ArduPi is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/brice-morin/ArduPi) and available as open-source (L-GPL)

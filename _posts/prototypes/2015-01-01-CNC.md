I have access to a *huge* CNC machine ([one of those](http://www.shopbottools.com/mProducts/prSalpha.htm)) that I used e.g. to make custom panels around my terrace. I am also working on a new 5-axis CNC machine, which we will build from scratch with Hans Petter Nerby based on [MachineKit](http://www.machinekit.io/) running on a Beagle Bone Black.

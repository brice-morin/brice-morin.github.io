[ThingML](http://www.ThingML.org) is a modeling language and code generation framework for heterogeneous embedded and distributed systems taking part in the Internet of Things (IoT). It consists of a metamodel supported by editors, a set of compilers (targeting C/Arduino, Java, JavaScript), and a set of network API generators targeting MQTT, WebSocket, Serial ,etc.

Franck Fleurey and myself are the [core developers of ThingML](https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/ThingML/contributors). ThingML is hosted on GitHub and available as open-source (Apache 2.0)

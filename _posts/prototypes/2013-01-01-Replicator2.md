We have recently acquired a [Makerbot Replicator 2](http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2.html) 3D printer to print cases for our IoT devices, and also to build some cool stuff. You can have a look at [my profile on Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/bmorin/analytics) to see some stuff I designed and built.

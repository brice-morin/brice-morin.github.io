CloudML is a modeling language for the provisioning of cloud resources from different cloud vendors and the deployment, monitoring and adaptation of software stacks on these cloud resources.

Nicolas Ferry, Franck Chauvel, Hui Song and myself are the core developers of CloudML. [CloudML is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/cloudml) and available as open-source (L-GPL)

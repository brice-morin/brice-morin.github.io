CloudML is a modeling language for the provisioning of cloud resources from different cloud vendors and the deployment, monitoring and adaptation of software stacks on these cloud resources.

Together with Nicolas Ferry and Franck Chauvel, I was one of the core developers of the initial version of CloudML, developed in the context of the REMICS project. Now, Nicolas Ferry, Franck Chauvel and Hui Song are the core developers of CloudML. [CloudML is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/cloudml) and available as open-source (L-GPL)

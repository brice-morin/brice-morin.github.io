CloudML is a modeling language for the provisioning of cloud resources from different cloud vendors and the deployment, monitoring and adaptation of software stacks on these cloud resources.

Nicolas Ferry, Franck Chauvel and myself are the core developers of CloudML. CloudML is hosted on GitHub, currently incubated in a private repository, and will soon be available as open-source (L-GPL)

SensApp is a cloud platform to collect and query sensor data.

SÃ©bastien Mosser is the main developper of SensApp. I have been contributing a few services to this platform: import/export from/to CSV, export of SRT to dub videos with the values of sensor that have been captured during those videos, factorization of data to provide clients with sorted and minimized data (yet complete) and a resampling service to change the sampling rate of data (e.g. from 1Hz to 5Hz) to provide clients with much lighter (and compressed with loss) data.

SensApp is hoster on GitHub and available as open-source (L-GPL)

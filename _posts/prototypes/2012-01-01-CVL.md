BVR, the Base Variation Resolution language (formerly CVL, the Common Variability Language), is a modeling language to express and enact variability in any existing modeling language, such as the UML or Domain-Specific Modeling Languages. I have used the initial version of CVL in the context of the CESAR project, and was involved in the new version of CVL/BVR.

Anatoly Vasilevskyi and Daisuke Shimbara are the core developers of BVR, while Oystein Haugen is responsible for the definition of the BVR metamodel. BVR is currently incubated on a private GitHub repository, and shall be publicly released as open-source later on.

CVL, the Common Variability Language, is a modeling language to express and enact variability in any existing modeling language, such as the UML or Domain-Specific Modeling Languages. I have used the initial version of CVL in the context of the CESAR project, and I am now involved in the new version of CVL.

Martin Fagereng Johansen, Anatoly Vasilevskyi and myself are the core developers of CVL (new version), while Oystein Haugen is driving its standardization at OMG. CVL is currently incubated on a private GitHub repository, and shall be released as open-source later on.

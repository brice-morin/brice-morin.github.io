CVL, the Common Variability Language, is a modeling language to express and enact variability in any existing modeling language, such as the UML or Domain-Specific Modeling Languages. I have used the initial version of CVL in the context of the CESAR project, and I am now involved in the new version of CVL.

Martin Fagereng Johansen, Anatoly Vasilevskyi are the core developers of CVL (new version), while Oystein Haugen is driving its standardization at OMG. I am an occasional contributor of CVL. CVL is currently incubated on a private GitHub repository, and shall be released as open-source later on.

[KMF](https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree-modeling-framework), the Kevoree Modeling Framework is an alternative to the EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework), in order to consider requirements (memory, performance, concurency, etc) needed by model@runtime.

Francois Fouquet (@dukeboard) and Gregory Nain the core developers of [KMF](https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree-modeling-framework/contributors). I am an early adopter and a brave beta-tester of KMF, and also involved in some technical discussions.

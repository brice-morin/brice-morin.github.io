title: Aspect-Oriented Modeling weavers
categories: [prototype, past]
---

I have been the main contributor of SmartAdapters, an EMF-based aspect model weaver, which can be appllied to different domains (via generative techniques). It has in particular been used in the DiVA project to manage the dynamic variability of adaptive system by weaving aspects into models@runtime. It also inspired the [GeKo weaver](https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/geko-model-weaver/).

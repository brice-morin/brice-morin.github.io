DiVA is a modeling language for the design, simulation and validation of adaptive systems. This language is inspired by the one developped during the DiVA EU project, with a completly new implementation for better scalability.

I am the [core developer](https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/diva/contributors) of DiVA (based on the work by Franck Fleurey and others in the DiVA consortium). DiVA is hosted on GitHub and available as open-source (L-GPL)

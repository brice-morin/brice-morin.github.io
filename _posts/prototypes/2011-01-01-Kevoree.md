[Kevoree](http://www.kevoree.org) aims at enabling distributed reconfigurable software development. Built around a component model, Kevoree leverages model@runtime approach to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.

Francois Fouquet (@dukeboard), Gregory Nain, Erwan Daubert and Jean-Emile Dartois are the core developers of [Kevoree](https://github.com/dukeboard/kevoree/contributors). I am a regular user of Kevoree and a brave beta-tester always willing to try new features and give feedback. Kevoree also implements some ideas (models@runtime), which I promoted in my PhD thesis, but is way more robust, scalable (and comes with a bunch of novel features) than the proof-of-concept which I implemented during my thesis.

Kevoree is hosted on GitHub and available as open-source (L-GPL)

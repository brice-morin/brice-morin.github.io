[ThingML](http://www.ThingML.org) is a modeling language for embedded and distributed systems taking part in the Internet of Things (IoT). It consists of a metamodel supported by editors, a set of compilers (targeting C/Arduino, Java/Scala), and integrates main standards in the IoT, such as COaP, ZigBee, Bluetooth (Low Energy).

Franck Fleurey and myself are the [core developers of ThingML](https://github.com/ffleurey/ThingML/contributors). ThingML is hosted on GitHub and available as open-source (L-GPL)

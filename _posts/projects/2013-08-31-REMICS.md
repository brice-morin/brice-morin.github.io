I am currently working for the [REMICS](http://www.remics.eu/) (Reuse and Migration of legacy applications to Interoperable Cloud Services) European project (STREP). I am leading Work Package 5, which is about Model-Driven Interoperability for cloud services, and actively contributing to the definition and implementation of CloudML in WP4.

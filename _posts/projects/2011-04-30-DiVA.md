My PhD was funded by DiVA (Dynamic Variability in Complex Adaptive Systems) Europen project (STREP). I was leading Work Package 3 the main pillar of DiVA, where we leveraged Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM) techniques at runtime to tame the complexity of adaptive systems.

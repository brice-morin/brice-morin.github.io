I have been working for the [CESAR](http://www.cesarproject.eu/) (Cost-Efficient methods and processes for safety relevant embedded systems) European project, where my role was, in close collaboration with the ABB industry partner, to model a safety critical system, and apply product-line engineering techniques based on the CVL tool (Common Variability Language).

I am currently working for the [HEADS](http://www.heads-project.eu/) project, a EU FP7 project, where my role is to define a modelling language to model services and a framework to integrate a family of compilers targeting the whole computing continuum, and distributing those services from resource-constrained nodes to large cloud resources.

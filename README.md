Brice Morin's website

Powered and Inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), provided under the [MIT license](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE)

If you are a researcher interested in a GitHub-based wiki to keep track of your publications, projects and prototypes, fell free to fork this project and modify as you wish. Since I intensively rely on Jekyll and on materials available on their GitHub repository, all the material available on this repository is available under the MIT license (see link above), except:

- the content of the `_posts` folder, which basically contains the inputs to generate the website, and
- all the `html` files, which you could however reuse after you remove all the Brice Morin-related content. In particular, make sure you modify `/index.html`, `/_includes/paper.html` (the links to my profiles on Google Scholar, etc) and `/_includes/footer.html` (it would however be nice to keep the mentions to Jekyll, and GitHub (if you host your pages there)). All the rest should be pretty much generated from `_posts`, but make sure you browse all these `html` files.
- `params.json`, which contains information specific to my website, which you could re-generate using GitHub pages wizard
- the content of the `img` folder, which belongs to GitHub and could be reused following the [_GitHug Logos and Usage_ terms](https://github.com/logos)

Brice Morin.
